    <h2>My Hobbies & Interests</h2>
    <p>In my free time, I absolutely love to cook. Whether it's baking homemade desserts, experimenting with new recipes, or preparing comfort food for my family, the kitchen is my happy place. Cooking brings out my creativity, gives me a sense of accomplishment, and allows me to share joy with the people I care about most.</p>
    <p>I also spend as much time as possible with my family — from Sunday dinners to game nights and road trips. These moments recharge me and keep me grounded. My family keeps me motivated, especially as I work toward completing my degree and building a successful future in the tech industry.</p>
    <p>Outside of cooking and family time, I enjoy music, browsing new tech trends, and learning new digital skills that support my goals. I believe in staying curious and always growing — that’s what makes life interesting and fulfilling.</p>
