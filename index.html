    <h1>Welcome to My e-Portfolio</h1>
    <p><strong>Hi, I’m Khadijah McDole Gunn</strong>, a proud student at Wallace Community College Selma, pursuing a degree in Computer Information Systems. With a projected graduation year of 2026, I am focused on building a future in technology — a field that excites me for its constant evolution and endless possibilities. I’ve always been passionate about learning how things work behind the scenes, especially in digital spaces, which is what led me to this career path.</p>
    <p>Beyond academics, I am a woman who values family, balance, and growth. I find peace and creativity in the kitchen — cooking is my therapy. When I'm not studying or coding, you can find me sharing a good meal with loved ones, laughing, and creating memories that fuel my motivation. Family is at the heart of everything I do.</p>
    <p>This e-Portfolio is a reflection of my journey so far. You’ll find my coursework, resume, hobbies, and a few photos that showcase who I am both inside and outside the classroom. I hope this space gives you a genuine sense of the professional I’m becoming and the person I am today.</p>
